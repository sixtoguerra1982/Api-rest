## Funx Backend developer test 

This is a simple software test is designed to know the way as you resolve a simple problem using software.

We are looking for candidates who really enjoy codign and try to make the most reausable softwares elements.

## The problem

In Funx it's a everyday work design and implement differents kinds of endpoints to be consumed by massively downloaded mobile apps.

In this case you must help our client Teleton Chile to have a copy of their news feed for their wordpress site on the Aplicat√≥n (Teleton's App).

Teleton wants to allow the users to comment and like the posts from their feed, so you must find the way to build a simple solution that go for the Teleton news feed and allow the users to comment and like the different posts through the app.

##We need to expose JSON REST endpoints to allow the users to:
* See the news feed.
* Like a post.
* Comment a post.


## Minimum objectives

* Parse feed in json 
* Model Database to store items from feed
* Model additional items in database to support likes and comments for items 
* Code API REST to list items
* Code API REST to recept comments for items
* Code API REST to recept likes

## Considerations

* Comments and likes can be anonymous (But you can assume and user_id instead it's the same)
* You don't need to expose the user's name on the comment or like.
* Frameworks to be used: You may use Ruby (Rails, Sinatra) or Python(Django or Flask).
